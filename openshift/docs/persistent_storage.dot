note as general
  This diagram outlines the design of all components and 
  their interactions within the OpenShift/Kubernetes environment.
  Squares represent pods, with each entry inside represeting a 
  running container within the pod (thus, any square can be scaled independently).
  Cylinders represent volume mounts that are shared amongst pods.
  
  This configuration repesents a setup using persistent storage by creating a
  single directory volume with sub-paths in it for each data storage.
